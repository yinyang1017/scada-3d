# React Graph Viz
This project shows how to use [2d-force-graph react components](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph) with a [Neo4j Database](https://neo4j.com/developer).

A Cypher query from a textarea is used to query the database.
The results are then rendered as graph visualization.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
